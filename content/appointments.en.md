# Book a free Pension Wise appointment

An appointment is a conversation with a pension specialist. You’ll talk about the options you have for taking your pension money.

Your appointment will last around 45 to 60 minutes and we will:

- explain your pension options
- explain how each option is taxed
- give you next steps to take

You can speak to us over the phone or face to face somewhere local to you.

## Before you book

You should be aged **50 or over** and have a **defined contribution** pension (not a final salary or career average pension).

[Not sure what pension type you have?](/en/pension-type-tool)
